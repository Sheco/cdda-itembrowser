Cataclysm DDA Item/Recipe Browser
=================================

Note: this is no longer maintained.

This is a simple tool to browse through the items and recipes available in [Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead](http://cataclysmdda.com), this is done by reading the game's data files and creating an optimized database linking everything together.

A copy of this code currently hosted by Sergio Duran (Sheco) at [http://cdda.estilofusion.com](http://cdda.estilofusion.com)

### Features

- Search for items and monsters.
- Show how an item can be crafted.
- Show recipes using each item.
- Automatic item catalogs, clothing, melee, ranged weapons, consumables, books, materials, qualities, flags, skills and gun mods.
- Monster catalogs.

### Installation

This can be used in a [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) environment. The current scripts provided have been tested on the official ubuntu/trusty32 vagrant box.

On windows, you will need an appropiate rsync.exe and ssh.exe on the path, (msys gets the job done). rsync was used instead of the default shared folders, because the shared folders are very slow.

To setup and run the environment, execute:

```
vagrant up
```

Everything should be up and running in a few minutes, you should be able to access the webapp at the appropiate address, it will probably be http://localhost:8000

### Manual instalation

If you don't want to run a vagrant setup, you only need to make sure you
have the appropiate dependencies.

* composer
* php5.4 (with the mcrypt extension)
* memcached
* A webserver

Then you can run the setup.sh script, which will download the game's source
code and composer dependencies.

The webserver should be able to read and write the files in the "storage"
directory inside the data file path.

### Contributing

Please read the [hacking guide](HACKING.md) to get an idea about how to read
